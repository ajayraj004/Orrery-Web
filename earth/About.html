            <p class="about-description">
                Welcome to our interactive orrery web app! Developed as part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge, this project offers an engaging and educational way for users to explore the celestial wonders of our solar system. From planets to Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs), Near-Earth Comets (NECs), and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs), our app brings NASA's data to life in a visually immersive experience.

                Our 3D solar system model allows users to interact with and visualize the planets, their orbits, and other celestial bodies. You can zoom in on individual planets, watch their orbits in real-time, and get detailed information about each one. This interactive model not only provides a beautiful representation of our solar system, but also serves as an educational tool for all ages.

            <p class="about-description">
                One of the standout features of our app is the Earth-to-Moon mission simulation. Using 3D graphics, we've recreated the journey from Earth to the Moon, allowing users to experience the mission visually. Whether you're exploring lunar missions or tracking the trajectory of spacecraft, this feature gives users a unique perspective on space travel.

                Asteroids and comets are fascinating yet often misunderstood celestial objects. Our app offers detailed information on Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs), Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs), and Near-Earth Comets (NECs). With interactive features, you can study their orbits, sizes, and potential risks. Our asteroid tracking feature allows you to simulate potential mining missions or examine methods of pushing PHAs into safer orbits.
            </p>
            <p class="about-description">
                Whether you're curious about asteroid mining, space missions, or just want to explore the wonders of our solar system, our dynamic orrery provides an immersive platform for learning and discovery.
